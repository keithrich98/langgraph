## Resolved Issues

### 1. Conversation History and Verification Issue

**Initial Problems:**
- The LLM was not receiving the entire conversation history
- Message conversion was inconsistent between different parts of the system
- The verification logic was only evaluating the most recent message against requirements

**How We Resolved It:**
1. **Fixed Message Conversion**: 
   - Enhanced `convert_messages` in `parent_workflow.py` to handle all message object types consistently
   - Improved `convert_messages_to_dict` in `api.py` with better type handling and error logging
   - Standardized message object handling across the codebase

2. **Improved History Tracking**:
   - Updated the verification node to properly log and use the full conversation history
   - Added debug logging to confirm the history was being accumulated correctly

3. **Enhanced Verification Logic**:
   - Created a new `extract_consolidated_answer` function that combines all human responses
   - Modified verification prompts to instruct the LLM to evaluate answers collectively
   - Added clear instructions about handling conversational-style answers
   - Implemented logging for the consolidated answers

**Root Cause:**
Initially, we thought the issue was with the conversation history not being properly accumulated. After fixing that, we discovered the real issue was that the verification logic was evaluating only the most recent user message, not considering information provided across multiple turns.

**Key Implementation Details:**
- The `add_messages` reducer was working correctly, but message object handling needed to be standardized
- The final solution consolidated all user responses into a single answer for evaluation
- System and user prompts were updated to emphasize considering information across all messages
