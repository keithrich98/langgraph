# Issues and Solutions

## Description of Current Code

### Core Files Overview

#### 1. parent_workflow.py
This file defines the core graph structure using LangGraph's StateGraph API. It orchestrates the questionnaire flow with the following key components:
- `ChatState` schema using TypedDict that includes conversation history with the `add_messages` reducer
- Multiple node functions (init_node, ask_node, answer_node, etc.) that handle different steps in the questionnaire
- Routing logic that determines flow between nodes based on verification results
- Graph construction with nodes, edges, and conditional routing
- Checkpointing setup for state persistence using shared_memory

#### 2. answer_verifier.py
Implements answer verification using LLMs:
- Connects to OpenAI API to evaluate user answers against question requirements
- Contains the `VerificationResult` Pydantic model that defines the schema for verification results
- Implements `verify_answer` function that evaluates if user responses meet requirements
- Includes `extract_consolidated_answer` utility that combines all user responses for proper evaluation
- Uses carefully crafted prompts to evaluate answers in conversational context

#### 3. api.py
Provides FastAPI endpoints for the questionnaire system:
- `/start` endpoint to initialize a new questionnaire session
- `/next` endpoint to process user answers and advance the questionnaire
- `/terms/{session_id}` endpoint to retrieve extracted medical terms 
- Handles message conversion between internal representations and API responses
- Maintains thread state and manages interrupts during the conversation flow
- Converts between different message formats (LangChain message objects and dictionaries)

#### 4. shared_memory.py
Implements the persistence layer for the LangGraph application:
- Extends LangGraph's `MemorySaver` with additional logging capabilities
- Provides `LoggingMemorySaver` that logs checkpoint operations for debugging
- Creates a shared singleton instance used across the application for state persistence

#### 5. logging_config.py
Configures the logging system for the application:
- Sets up the "questionnaire" logger with appropriate formatting
- Configures file and console handlers with different log levels
- Sets up log file paths and naming conventions
- Provides structured logging across the application

#### 6. test_questionnaire_manual.py
Contains manual testing functionality for the questionnaire system:
- Implements a test loop that interacts with the API endpoints
- Simulates user interaction by providing answers to questions
- Helps verify the questionnaire flow and verification logic
- Used during development to identify and fix issues

#### 7. term_extractor.py
Implements medical terminology extraction functionality:
- Provides asynchronous processing using threading
- Uses LLM for intelligent term extraction from medical text
- Includes robust error handling and fallback parsing strategies
- Directly updates shared memory with extraction results
- Offers both synchronous and asynchronous execution options

## Architecture Changes

Based on a comprehensive review of the codebase, the following architecture changes are recommended to improve code manageability, performance, and adherence to best practices with LangGraph's graph API:

### 1. State Model Refactoring

#### Files to Change:
- **parent_workflow.py**
- **state.py**
- **shared_memory.py**

#### Suggested Changes:
- Replace TypedDict with Pydantic models for state management to add validation, better typing, and clearer structure
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization methods to handle complex state objects
- Move state definition to dedicated `state.py` module instead of embedding in parent_workflow.py
- Example refactoring:

```python
# state.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class VerificationResult(BaseModel):
    is_valid: bool
    verification_message: str
    question_index: Optional[int] = None
    answer: Optional[str] = None

class ChatState(BaseModel):
    current_question_index: int = 0
    questions: List[Dict] = Field(default_factory=list)
    conversation_history: List[Any] = Field(default_factory=list)
    responses: Dict[int, str] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    is_complete: bool = False
    verified_answers: Dict[int, Dict[str, str]] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    term_extraction_queue: List[int] = Field(default_factory=list)
    extracted_terms: Dict[str, List[str]] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    last_extracted_index: int = -1
    verification_result: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    thread_id: Optional[str] = None
    trigger_extraction: bool = False
```

### 2. Workflow Refactoring

#### Files to Change:
- **parent_workflow.py**

#### Suggested Changes:
- Simplify routing logic using clear, focused conditional functions
- Reduce duplication in process_extraction_in_background and extract_node_sync functions
- Separate core graph construction from node implementation
- Remove unused nodes and simplify flow
- Specifically target:
  - Consolidate duplicate message conversion code
  - Reduce complexity in process_extraction_in_background
  - Simplify router functions with clearer edge cases

```python
# Example simplified router
def verification_result_router(state: ChatState) -> str:
    """Route based on verification result - simplified."""
    is_valid = state.verification_result.get("is_valid", False)
    return "process_answer_node" if is_valid else "answer_node"
```

### 3. Term Extraction Architecture

#### Files to Change:
- **term_extractor.py**
- **parent_workflow.py**

#### Suggested Changes:
- Implement proper async pattern using Python's asyncio instead of manual threading
- Refactor to use a dedicated queue manager for extraction tasks
- Simplify term extraction thread management with cleaner interface
- Replace background extraction logic with more reliable approach:

```python
# Example simplified background task manager
class ExtractionManager:
    def __init__(self, memory_saver):
        self.memory_saver = memory_saver
        self.queue = asyncio.Queue()
        self.running = False
        
    async def start_processing(self):
        self.running = True
        while self.running:
            task = await self.queue.get()
            await self.process_extraction(task)
            self.queue.task_done()
            
    async def process_extraction(self, task):
        # Process extraction and update state atomically
```

### 4. API Refactoring

#### Files to Change:
- **api.py**

#### Suggested Changes:
- Streamline message conversion code that is duplicated across functions and modules
- Move validation logic into Pydantic models (using the refactored state models)
- Simplify thread tracking mechanisms
- Add streaming response support

```python
# Example simplified message conversion
def convert_messages(messages):
    """Single, unified message conversion function."""
    # Implementation that handles all message formats consistently
```

### 5. Logging and Error Handling

#### Files to Change:
- **parent_workflow.py**
- **term_extractor.py**
- **api.py**
- **logging_config.py**

#### Suggested Changes:
- Standardize error handling patterns across all modules
- Reduce excessive debug logging in production code
- Implement structured logging for better analysis
- Add context managers for critical operations

```python
# Example context manager for extraction operations
@contextmanager
def extraction_context(thread_id, idx):
    """Context manager for extraction operations with proper logging and error handling."""
    logger.info(f"Starting extraction for index {idx} in thread {thread_id}")
    try:
        yield
        logger.info(f"Completed extraction for index {idx}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during extraction: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
        # Handle failure case
```

### 6. Test Coverage Enhancement

#### Files to Change:
- **test_questionnaire_manual.py**
- Add new test files

#### Suggested Changes:
- Create dedicated unit test modules for each component
- Implement integration tests for the complete flow
- Add performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Create mocks for external dependencies (LLM, memory)

### 7. Duplicate Code Elimination

#### Files with Duplication:
- **parent_workflow.py** and **api.py**: message conversion logic
- **parent_workflow.py**: extraction processing logic
- **term_extractor.py**: error handling and state update patterns

#### Suggested Changes:
- Extract duplicate message conversion to a shared utils module
- Refactor background processing into a dedicated service
- Standardize state update patterns

### 8. Performance Optimization Areas

- Reduce redundant state loading/saving operations in term_extractor.py
- Implement proper caching for LLM operations in answer_verifier.py
- Optimize conversation history processing for longer questionnaires
- Replace deep copy operations with more efficient state update mechanisms

### 9. Unused Functions for Removal

- `tasks_checker` and `tasks_checker_router` (redundant monitoring)
- `extract_node_sync` (replaced by async implementation)
- Redundant thread_id retrieval attempts in extract_node

These changes will significantly improve code maintainability, reduce complexity, and enhance performance while maintaining all current functionality.
