2. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add unit tests for message conversion functions
   - Implement snapshot testing for the verification process
   - Create integration tests for the complete conversation flow

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize message processing for larger conversation histories
   - Consider caching mechanisms for repeated verification requests

4. **User Experience**:
   - Provide more detailed feedback on missing requirements
   - Add confidence scores to verification results
